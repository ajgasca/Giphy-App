# Giphy-App
Gif App utilizing Javascript, jQuery &amp; the Giphy API

This app allows a user to click on a button displayed at the top of the page that will display ten gifs related to the button. The gifs are displayed as still images until the user clicks on them, and with another click can be returned to still images. Gif ratings are displayed for a user's discretion. A user can also Add their own button to the top of the page that will also generate gif related to the newly-created button.

My general approach to making the app work was initially focusing on retrieving information from the Giphy API with an AJAX call. I created four initial buttons. I then applied a click function to the four buttons using jQuery that would utilize an AJAX call. By ensuring that I was receiving information from the API in the console, I then transferred the data to be seen via HTML. Aftewards, I focused on creating a form that would allow the user to add their own buttons to the page. Once, that was functioning I applied CSS using an image from Plexels and Google Fonts.
